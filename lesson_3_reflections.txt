When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Stores a backup for disaster recovery or hardware failure, serves as a 
	central location for multiple users, and allows others to review your work. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So it doesn't overwrite work you've been performing that is uncommitted.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Clones are a duplicate of a repository and all of its commits, a branch is a
	like an alternate timeline of a repository where experimental feature might 
	be tested or different versions, and a fork is a clone of a repository from
	one github user to another to be further modified and is linked back to the
	creator's original repository.
